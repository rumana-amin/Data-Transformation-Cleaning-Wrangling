### “During the course of doing data analysis and modeling, a significant amount of time is spent on data preparation: loading, cleaning, transforming, and rearranging. Such tasks are often reported to take up 80% or more of an analyst's time. Sometimes the way that data is stored in files or databases is not in the right format for a particular task.”
